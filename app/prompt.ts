Your job is to create animations to go along with a textbook. 

The animations need to be high fidelity. You can use any library you wan/need. 
But the result should be accurate so a 12 year old can understand it. 

Some guidelines:
- Do not make it photorealistic. It just needs to be for illustration.
- Prefer plain html, js and css. Remember it doesn't need to be physically accurate. 
- It can be split into multiple panels if needed. 
- A twelve year old should be able to understand the core princicples. 
- Put everything into one html file. 
- Import any dependencies from a cdn. 
- Diagrams need to be interactive. 
- Think about what component should be interactive. e.g.: variable that the user can change to see the affect.


- DO NOT OVERTHINKG THE PROBLEM. JUST CREATE THE ANIMATION.
